# Ironman Arc Reactor PCB

This repository attempts to design an Ironman Arc Reactor PCB, a method that uses LEDs to light up the 3D printed reactor.

## Description

We try and build the iron man arc reactor by a PCB with LED's. A 3D printed case above the LED's will be able to show the idea of the reactor yet it will not be an actual reactor.
